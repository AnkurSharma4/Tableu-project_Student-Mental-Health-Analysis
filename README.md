## Insights
## 1. Age-Based Dietary Habits

Breakdown by Gender, Sleep Duration, and Dietary Habits:

**Healthy (Blue):**

Males and females sleeping 7-8 hours generally show the highest adherence to healthy dietary habits.


**Moderate (Orange):**

This is most prominent in individuals with 5-6 hours and more than 8 hours of sleep.

Sleep duration of less than 5 hours shows lower moderate dietary adherence.


**Unhealthy (Red):**

Individuals with less than 5 hours sleep exhibit higher unhealthy dietary habits.

This pattern is more noticeable in females.



**Key Insight:**
Sleep duration significantly correlates with dietary habits. Longer sleep (7-8 hours) tends to promote healthier diets, while less sleep is associated with unhealthy eating habits.

## 2. Mental History Based Financial Stress

The pie chart shows financial stress and mental history distribution across different sleep durations.

Different segments likely highlight stress variations linked to sleep and family mental health history.

**Key Insight:**
Financial stress may compound mental health challenges, particularly for individuals with lower sleep durations.

## 3. Study Hour Based Sleep Duration

Study Hours by Sleep Duration and Gender:

Individuals sleeping 7-8 hours have the 2nd highest variance of study hours with healthy lifestyle, indicating balanced sleep and study habits.

Study hours reduce for those sleeping less than 5 hours.

Both genders show similar patterns, though males and females with 7-8 hours sleep perform consistently better with regard to their health.


**Key Insight:**
Optimal sleep duration (7-8 hours) is associated with improved study and health efficiency.



---

## Overall Summary Points

**Sleep Duration Impact:**

Optimal sleep (7-8 hours) promotes healthier dietary habits and more study hours.

Reduced sleep (less than 5 hours) correlates with unhealthy diets and lower study efficiency.


**Gender Trends:**

Both males and females show similar patterns, but females may have slightly higher unhealthy habits with less sleep.


**Mental Stress Link:**

Financial stress and mental health history may impact individuals' sleep duration and habits.
